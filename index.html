        <p>Slaying dragons has been a hobby of mine for over forty years.
            You wouldn't think that by looking at me. I'm a man entering his
            senior years, but inside beats the heart of a warrior. My favorite pastime
            is playing table top roleplaying games, specifically older versions of Dungeons & Dragons.
            </p>
            <p>What makes me want to spend hours at a gaming table, pouring over rulebooks, moving lead figures,
                and rolling dice? There are several reasons why this is a favorite pastime on mine.
                The answer that first comes to mind is that it is pure fun. I've have a regular group of
                gamer friends who meet usually once a week to play Whitebox, a D&D clone. We are few in number,
                but mighty in mirth and bad puns. Being at the gaming table with other people that
                enjoy the hobby is a rewarding experience. The game is a part storytelling, part tactics, and always fun.
                Imagine a time where you've sat around a table with friends and played a board game. The roleplaying games
                that we play are a great way to get together with friends, have some fun, and put aside our cares for awhile.
                </p>
                <p>Another reason I enjoy roleplaying games is the creativity it demands. I enjoy writing adventures for the game.
                    Think of it as a movie script. I set the scene and populate it with characters the players will meet and adversaries
                    that the players need to overcome. The stage is set and the players take the stage as a character...fighter, magic-user,
                    cleric, or thief. They interact with a world that I created and through interaction they make their mark on the world.
                    Playing roleplaying games is a great exercise to strengthen your imagination and writing skills.
                </p>
                <p>My gaming friends are scattered around the country and one friend is in Canada. We get together on Roll20, a browser based
                    gaming table. It's not as good as face to face gaming, but it works out well. We play for just a couple hours each weekend.
                    It fits our schedules and gives us all something to look forward to. There are endless ways to play and many different roleplaying
                    games available. I am fond of medieval adventures and also pulp era gaming. No matter what your genre, you'll find someone
                    out there playing it. If you've never tried a table top roleplaying game, check out your local comic or game shop. They will
                    most likely have a schedule of open games at the store to get you started. I've been at this for over forty years and still
                    look forward to every weekend that I get a chance to roll the dice.
